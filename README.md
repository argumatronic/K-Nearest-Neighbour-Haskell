# K Nearest Neighbour (in Haskell - a.k.a. babby's first Haskell)

Having spent some time with Typed Racket, I decided to try my hand at Haskell. I chose to tackle KNN because it's fairly simple and I'm familiar with it.

Long story short, Haskell is great. I particularly like the partial application of functions - in Racket this would require a call to curry, a lambda or a macro, but in Haskell you can just throw them around with almost no extra syntax. Overall the code feels a lot cleaner than the TR equivalent and just looks less dense.
